### Communication
- **Meetings:**  
  Our meeting schedule is flexible. It can be online or in-person, whatever works best for the team. We will meet once a week to stay on track and make sure everyone is informed.
  
- **Decision Making:**
  - **Consensus:** We try to reach an agreement together. If this is difficult, we will discuss it in depth.
  - **Vote:** If we can't agree, we'll take a vote. Majority votes win, but we also remember what others think.
  - **Leadership decisions:** Team leaders have the final say on major matters, but they listen to everyone first.
  - **Problem Solver:** If we're really at an impasse, we ask our superiors to help us make a decision.
  - **Record keeping:** We keep track of our choices and why we made them, so everyone knows what happened.
  - **Periodically review:** We review our choices from time to time to see if they still fit.

### Conflict Resolution
- **Open communication:** If a problem arises, let's discuss it openly. No secrets, just frank conversations.
- **Active listening:** We listen when others speak. We try to understand their point of view before responding.
- **Respect differences:** It's okay to disagree. We just have to disagree in a way that respects everyone.
- **Cooling-off period:** If things get heated, we take a break. This is a time to calm down and think.
- **Mediation:** If we can't solve it ourselves, we ask a neutral person to help us find a solution.
- **Agree:** Once we find a solution, we agree to it and move forward together.
