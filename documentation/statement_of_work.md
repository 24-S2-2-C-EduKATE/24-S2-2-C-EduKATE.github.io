## Project Overview
EduKATE Innovations is dedicated to bridging the gender gap in STEM education by developing engaging, educational toys for young girls. The companyâ€™s first product, a programmable robotic dog, is in the final stages of development. This project involves the development of an app that teaches coding through interactive play and game-like lessons.

## Client Vision and Goals		
EduKATE Innovations was founded with the mission to inspire and empower young girls in STEM fields through innovative educational products. Our goal is to make STEM education accessible and fun, encouraging young girls to explore coding and robotics from an early age. Our first product, a programmable robotic dog, is designed to engage and educate our audience, setting the foundation for future products like Kate-E the coding doll.

## Project Objectives
The client's goal is to develop an application to teach coding, allowing users to control programmable robotic dogs by coding on this application. This application will provide three different coding languages to meet different levels of experience and learning needs. The main functions include:

- **Picture Block Coding**: Ideal for beginners, this visual language uses images to represent coding concepts. Users can create coding logic by dragging and dropping graphical blocks, which helps them understand basic coding principles.
- **Word Block Coding**: A step up from picture blocks, this method uses words and phrases to introduce coding syntax. Users create more complex coding logic by combining blocks with text labels, facilitating a transition to text-based coding.
- **Text Coding**: For advanced users, this method involves typing out code, providing a more traditional coding experience. Users can write and run code, learning advanced coding skills and gaining experience in a real coding environment.

Additionally, this app needs to have an account management system to protect user details. The main functions will be to track users' progress through lessons and allow them to save their code. The following additional features will be considered after the above:

- **Hardware Software Integration**: Ensuring seamless integration between the hardware (robotic dog) and the software (app). This integration will enable users to effectively control and operate the robotic dog using the app.
- **Code Translations**: Implementing an integration between the three programming languages offered in the app. This feature will allow the code produced by the user in one language to be translated into the next more complex language, helping users see their progress and understand the relationship between different coding methods (for example, the picture block language to the word block language).
- **Lessons**: Developing a series of interactive coding lessons that guide children through the coding languages. These lessons will be structured in a way similar to Duolingo, starting from very simple concepts (like understanding decimals) and progressing to more complex topics (such as using libraries).
