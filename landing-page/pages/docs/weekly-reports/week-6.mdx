# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
  
#### Task Allocation Until Audit 3 [#223](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/223): 
We established a clear task allocation strategy leading up to Audit 3. The team will be divided into two groups: three members will focus on completing the interface during Week 7, while four members will dedicate Week 8 to developing the logical components of the project. This structured approach is designed to enhance productivity and minimize communication issues by assigning specific roles each week.

#### Output in front-end code:
This week, in order to successfully present in audit, we programmed some visible output in our front-end code. We got a finished homepage with a button that can jump to another page; and a picture block page, although just a demonstration of the layout, we primarily determined the layout of the whole page. All our designs and code structures lay a foundation for further expansion.

#### Successful Completion of Audit 3 [#211](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/211): 
At the end of Week 6, we successfully completed our audit and received positive feedback from our tutor. The tutor commended our organization, clarity in documentation, and the quality of our presentation materials. This recognition is a testament to our hard work and collaboration throughout the project.
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Unfamiliarity with Flutter [Risk #191](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/191): 
Most of the team members still lack experience with Flutter, which continues to be a challenge, potentially leading to delays and increased bugs in development. To address this, some of us that already learned Flutter continue to work on the coding part, while the others need to not only learn the Flutter structure but also focus on the documentation part to maintain a good form of our logs.

## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
This week, we gained valuable insights into effective project management through the implementation of a structured document management system. The decision to migrate all documentation to GitHub has highlighted the importance of organization in maintaining clarity and efficiency within the team.

Additionally, we learned the significance of clear communication regarding project requirements. The proactive approach of scheduling joint meetings with clients and developers will help ensure alignment on project goals moving forward. By documenting all feedback and decisions consistently, we are also enhancing our risk management practices.

## Plans for Next Week
### Goals for Next Week: 

Focus on Flutter Training: We will conduct training sessions on Flutter to improve team members' proficiency with the framework before diving into development tasks.

Clarify Client Requirements: Following our joint meeting with the client and their developer, we will document any changes or clarifications made regarding project requirements.

Continue Development Work: After Audit 3, we will proceed with coding tasks as per our task allocation strategy, focusing on both interface completion and logical component development.

# Conclusion

Week 6 was a highly productive period for the EduKATE Project Team, culminating in a successful audit that received commendation from our tutor. Significant decisions regarding document management and task allocation strategies contributed to this success. While challenges related to unfamiliarity with Flutter and inconsistent requirements persist, we are taking proactive steps to address these issues. The insights gained this week will guide our efforts as we move forward in the project, fostering improved communication and collaboration among team members. We look forward to building on our progress in the upcoming week.
