# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
#### First Version of the Framework [#199](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/199): 
This week, we successfully developed the first version of the UML diagram, which serves as a foundational framework for our application. This diagram outlines the key functionalities and interactions within the app, providing clarity on how different components will work together.
  
#### Decision to Use PyQt [#198](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/198):
After thorough discussions, we decided to use PyQt as the framework for our application development. This choice was made due to its flexibility and ability to create cross-platform applications, which aligns with our goal of reaching a wider audience.
  
#### Meetings Held:
 - Week 1-2 Shadow Meeting [#188](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/188): In this meeting, we presented our work from the past two weeks, highlighting our progress on the SOW, Team Charter, and landing page. We received valuable feedback from the shadow group, particularly regarding the need to refine our log files and address potential security and privacy issues during development. Additionally, we discussed the shadow group’s progress on their website project, which provided us with insights into best practices for our own development.
 - Week 3 Client Meeting [#110](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/110): We established a regular meeting time for our client interactions and prioritized tasks to ensure the main feature—visual dog programming—is completed promptly. We set clear expectations about what can be achieved this semester, emphasizing our focus on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) that appeals to our target audience of young children, particularly girls. The meeting also facilitated direct communication with the lead developer, enhancing our ability to ask technical questions and streamline our development process.
 - Week 3 Team Meeting [#109](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/109): During this meeting, we discussed the tasks needed to complete Audit 1, finalized the SOW and Team Charter, and prepared the landing page. We also determined our document storage solution, opting for Google Drive for collaboration and GitHub for version control. The UML framework was reviewed and identified as needing refinement to capture specific application features. We decided to split our work into three parallel tasks: UI, Controller, and Action, based on the UML diagram.
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Learning Curve with New Frameworks: 
While we decided on PyQt and Flutter for development, the team faces a learning curve, particularly with Flutter, as none of the members are currently familiar with it. This may impact our timeline as we need to allocate time for team members to gain proficiency in the framework.

#### Potential Development Challenges: 
We identified several potential challenges related to hardware communication and the implementation of the block programming language. While these tasks are complex, we agreed that they are manageable and will be addressed as we progress through the project.

### Team Collaboration
The meetings fostered a collaborative environment where team members could share ideas and provide feedback. The discussions during the shadow meeting and client meeting helped clarify our project objectives and reinforced the importance of aligning our development efforts with client expectations. The decision to split tasks into parallel efforts will enhance our efficiency and allow us to tackle various components simultaneously.


## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
This week, the team gained valuable insights into the importance of clear communication and task prioritization. The client meeting emphasized the need to focus on delivering a unique value proposition that appeals to our target audience, which will guide our development efforts moving forward. Additionally, the discussions around security and privacy considerations during the shadow meeting highlighted the importance of these factors in our development process.

## Plans for Next Week
### Goals for Next Week

#### Complete Logs and Improve Landing Page [#18](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/18): 
We will finalize the logs and enhance the landing page to ensure it effectively displays all relevant project artifacts, including the SOW and Team Charter.

#### Refine UML Framework [#200](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/200): 
The UML diagram will be refined to better capture the specific features required by the application, ensuring that it serves as a comprehensive guide for development.

#### Continue Learning PyQt [#198](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/198): 
Team members will dedicate time to learning the PyQt and Flutter frameworks to ensure we can effectively implement our project requirements.

## Conclusion
Overall, Week3 was a productive and insightful period for the EduKATE Project Team. We made significant strides in developing our framework, establishing clear communication with our clients, and organizing our tasks for efficient collaboration. While we encountered challenges related to learning new frameworks and addressing potential development issues, the team demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Moving forward, we are optimistic about our progress and look forward to building on our achievements in the upcoming week.
