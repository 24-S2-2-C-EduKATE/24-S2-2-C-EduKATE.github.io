# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
#### Second Version of the Framework ([#200](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/200)):
This week, we successfully completed the second version of our UML framework. This refined diagram captures the essential functionalities of our application and provides a clearer roadmap for development. The updates were based on feedback from our previous meetings and discussions, ensuring that we are aligned with project goals.
  
#### Documentation Storage Decision [#121](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/121):
We decided to use Google Drive as our centralized storage platform for all project documentation. This decision aims to streamline our document management process and avoid confusion caused by using multiple URLs. By consolidating our documentation in one place, we can enhance accessibility and organization.
  
#### Standardized Documentation Format Decision [#120](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/120): 
We established a standardized format for our documentation, including team minutes, decision logs, and risk logs. This format will help ensure clarity and consistency, making it easier for team members to summarize and reference information.

#### Project Managers Appointed [#196](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/196):
We appointed two project managers, Finn McClusky and Siyi Liu, to oversee project coordination and ensure that tasks are completed on time. This decision is expected to improve accountability and streamline communication within the team.
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Scope Management [#104](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/104):
We faced challenges related to unclear client requirements, which led to potential misunderstandings and scope changes. To mitigate this risk, we have scheduled regular meetings with the client to clarify requirements and document any changes thoroughly. This proactive approach aims to minimize the risk of project delays and rework.

#### Communication Issues [#106](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/106):
There has been a lack of communication with the head developer, resulting in an unclear understanding of the current state of the code and completed features. To address this, we will implement regular sync-up meetings with the head developer and establish a shared documentation platform to record all updates and progress.


#### Lack of Experience [#105](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/105): 
The team continues to navigate the challenges of limited experience with this type of project, which has created uncertainty regarding the architecture and initial steps. To mitigate this, we are conducting research, seeking advice from experienced developers, and breaking the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
 

### Team Collaboration
This week, our team made significant progress in collaboration, particularly through the appointment of two project managers, Finn McClusky and Siyi Liu [#196](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/196). Their leadership has enhanced coordination and accountability, ensuring that tasks are clearly defined and followed up on. During our Week 4 Team Meeting, we discussed feedback from our tutor regarding standardized documentation formats, which will help maintain clarity and consistency across the project. By agreeing on a unified format for our logs, we are fostering an environment where every team member can easily contribute to and access important information.

Our collaboration has also been strengthened through co-creation, as team members actively participated in refining our project goals and documentation. The emphasis on effective communication has prompted us to schedule regular sync-up meetings with the head developer, ensuring alignment on project progress. Overall, these collaborative efforts have not only improved our workflow but also fostered a sense of ownership and teamwork among members, enhancing our ability to work together effectively.


## Learning and Insights

### New Skills and Knowledge

This week, the team gained valuable insights into project management and documentation practices. The implementation of standardized formats for our logs has highlighted the importance of organization in collaborative projects, improving our ability to track progress and make informed decisions. Additionally, discussions around scope management and communication strategies have equipped us with the skills to identify and document unclear requirements, helping us mitigate misunderstandings with the client.

The feedback received from our client emphasized the need for clear definitions of project outputs, reinforcing the significance of effective communication in our work. By actively seeking and incorporating feedback, we are developing our skills in stakeholder engagement and project shaping, which are essential for the success of the EduKATE project. Overall, these learning experiences will guide our efforts as we move forward in the project. 

### Useful Feedback Received

We received valuable feedback from both our client and tutor regarding our project documentation and management tools [#170](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/170), [#171](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/171). The client emphasized the need for clearer time allocation and communication, especially given their limited coding knowledge. They expressed concern over the lack of essential documents, such as risk registers, decision logs, and feedback logs. This feedback has highlighted the importance of establishing a robust documentation framework early in the project [#175](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/175), [#178](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/178).


Positive feedback was also received regarding our effective team role allocation and communication. The client noted that our team has a clear understanding of each member's strengths, which contributes to effective collaboration. Additionally, our adaptability in clarifying project requirements has been recognized as a positive aspect of our stakeholder engagement [#181](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/181), [#186](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/186).
