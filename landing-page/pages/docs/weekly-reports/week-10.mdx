This week, our primary focus was on preparing for the Audit 3 presentation. During our Week 10 Team Meeting [#294](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/294), we reviewed each team memberâ€™s progress on their assigned sections and conducted a full rehearsal of the presentation. This rehearsal allowed us to practice timing and transitions between sections, ensuring a seamless delivery.
  
#### Successful Presentation Delivery [#295](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/295): 
In our Week 10 Tutorial Meeting, we successfully delivered the Audit 3 presentation. Each team member presented their assigned sections, covering key points of the project effectively. We addressed questions from the tutor and examiner, providing detailed explanations of various aspects of our work.
  
#### Feedback Received: 
We received constructive feedback from our client, tutor, and examiner. The client highlighted areas for improvement and potential adjustments for future development. The tutor suggested using Unity to simulate interactions with the robotic dog to reduce reliance on multiple physical replicas. Additionally, they advised us to consider the connection between the app and the robotic dog for seamless integration and recommended a more comprehensive structure for complex app components.
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Final Preparations: 
As we approached the presentation date, ensuring that all materials were accurate and coherent required meticulous attention to detail. We faced some last-minute adjustments to refine our slides and presentation content.

#### Anticipating Questions: 
Preparing for potential questions from the tutor and examiner posed a challenge as we needed to identify key areas of uncertainty in our presentation. However, through team discussions, we were able to develop clear and concise responses.
  
### Team Collaboration
The collaborative efforts during our meetings were instrumental in our success. Each team member took ownership of their assigned sections, contributing to a cohesive presentation. The rehearsal allowed us to identify any weak points in our delivery and address them proactively.


## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
Effective Communication: The importance of clear communication was reinforced throughout this process. Regular check-ins allowed us to stay aligned on our goals and ensure that everyone was prepared for their respective roles in the presentation.

Feedback as a Growth Tool: The feedback received from our client and tutor will be invaluable as we refine our project moving forward. Constructive criticism helps us identify areas for improvement and align our future efforts with client expectations.

## Goals Moving Forward

#### Finalize Tag Report [#306](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/306): 
Our immediate next step is to complete the tag report, ensuring all necessary information is included clearly.

#### Foundational Plan Development [#307](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/307): 
We will develop a foundational plan outlining major objectives and key milestones for the upcoming semester. This plan will guide our continued progress on the project.


## Conclusion
Overall, Week 10 marked a significant milestone for the EduKATE Project Team as we successfully delivered our Audit 3 presentation and received valuable feedback from stakeholders. Despite facing challenges related to final preparations and anticipating questions, our collaborative efforts led to a successful outcome. As we transition into the next semester, we are committed to using the insights gained from this experience to enhance our project further. We look forward to refining our work based on feedback and continuing to make progress in developing an engaging educational application.
