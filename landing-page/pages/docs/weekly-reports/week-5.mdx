# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
#### Documentation Improvements ([#125](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/125), [#50](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/50), [#51](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/51), [#52](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/52), [#53](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/53), [#55](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/55)):
We made significant progress in enhancing our documentation practices this week. We decided to migrate all existing documents to [GitHub](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io), organizing them into boards for better visualization and management. This decision was made to centralize and streamline document management, as our current Google Drive storage was becoming difficult to manage and access.

#### Presentation Tasks Assigned ([#190](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/190)):
To ensure a well-organized and thorough presentation for the upcoming audit, we divided the presentation into three key parts: SOW (Statement of Work), Landing Page, and Real Code. Each part was assigned to 2-3 team members, allowing us to focus on each area in depth and leverage individual strengths.

#### Front-end flutter app (Desktop) ([#167](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/167)):
In this week, our front-end members learned flutter language and developed a demo desktop app with simple content. We are still in the progress of learning.

## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Unfamiliarity with Flutter [#191](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/191):
Team members' lack of experience with Flutter continues to pose a challenge, as it may lead to delays in project milestones and increased likelihood of bugs. To mitigate this risk, we will organize comprehensive Flutter training sessions and implement paired programming with those who have experience in similar technologies.

#### Inconsistent Client and Developer Requirements [#194](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/194):
A discrepancy was identified between the client's initial requirements and the instructions received from their developer regarding the inclusion of a design course as a project deliverable. To address this, we will schedule a joint meeting with the client and their developer to clarify requirements, document agreed-upon deliverables, and establish regular check-ins to monitor any changes.

#### Differing Documentation Standards [#193](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/193):
The clinic requires documentation via GitHub for version control and markdown formatting, while the tutor prefers submissions in Google Docs for its collaborative features. To mitigate this risk, we will opt to use GitHub for all documentation and incorporate detailed tags and structured documentation to meet the tutor's requirements as closely as possible.

## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
This week, we gained valuable insights into the importance of clear communication and documentation practices. The discussions during our meetings highlighted the need for accessible and well-organized documentation, ensuring that key information can be quickly found by any team member or auditor.

We also learned the significance of defining project goals and deliverables clearly, categorizing them into "Must Have," "Could Use," and "Would Be Nice" features. This approach helps us prioritize tasks and manage expectations effectively.

Additionally, we gained a deeper understanding of risk management, particularly the need to document all feedback and decisions consistently. By establishing a clear process for handling feedback and decisions, we can ensure that all team members are aligned and that risks are mitigated proactively.

## Plans for Next Week
### Goals for Next Week

#### Finalize Presentation Materials [#190](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/190): 
We will continue working on the presentation materials, ensuring that each section is well-prepared and that the overall presentation is cohesive and polished.

#### Address Flutter Compatibility Issues [#167](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/167): 
We will confirm and address any compatibility issues that may arise when using Flutter across different platforms, such as iOS and Android.

#### Continue Learning and Development: Team members will dedicate time to learning new technologies and continuing development efforts, focusing on the core functionality of the programming interface.

#### Prepare for Week 6 Audit: 
We will refine our logs, prepare a downloadable app demo, and ensure that all project progress is clearly documented in preparation for the Week 6 audit.

## Conclusion
Week 5 was a productive period for the EduKATE Project Team, marked by significant improvements in documentation practices and the assignment of presentation tasks. While we continue to face challenges related to unfamiliarity with Flutter and inconsistent requirements, we are committed to addressing these issues proactively. The insights gained this week, particularly regarding communication and risk management, will guide our efforts as we move forward. We are optimistic about the upcoming week and look forward to delivering a successful audit presentation.
