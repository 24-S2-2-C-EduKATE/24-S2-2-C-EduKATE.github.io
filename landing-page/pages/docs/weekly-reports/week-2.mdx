# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
#### Task Allocation for Audit Files and Landing Page [#117](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/117): 
This week, we successfully allocated specific tasks related to the Statement of Work (SOW), Team Charter, and the development of the landing page. Each team member was assigned clear responsibilities, ensuring that all crucial components of the project are addressed efficiently. This structured approach allowed us to distribute the workload evenly, which is essential for maintaining high standards and meeting deadlines.
  
#### Weekly Team and Client Meetings [#116](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/116), [#107](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/107), [#108](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/108): 
We established a routine of holding weekly team meetings and client meetings every Friday. This decision was made to enhance coordination and ensure consistent communication among team members. During these meetings, we discussed progress, addressed any issues, and aligned our efforts with client expectations. The first of these meetings helped solidify our project goals and set a collaborative tone for future interactions.
  
#### Milestone Establishment [#118](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/118): 
We set clear milestones for the app development project, outlining specific task goals for each phase. This decision was crucial in ensuring that we stay on track and complete each phase on time. The milestones will help us monitor our progress, identify potential bottlenecks early, and maintain alignment with project deadlines and client expectations. By the end of this semester, we aim to have a functional app with basic features, such as the image drag functionality.
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Time Conflicts [#44](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/44): 
One of the significant challenges we faced this week was the difficulty in coordinating schedules among team members. Initial attempts to find common meeting times led to conflicts, which risked delaying our progress. This situation highlighted the need for a more effective scheduling system to accommodate everyone’s availability. We recognized that establishing a shared calendar could improve our coordination and prevent future conflicts.

  
### Team Collaboration
Despite the scheduling challenges, the team demonstrated strong collaboration during our meetings. We effectively discussed project objectives, allocated tasks, and shared updates on our individual progress. The open communication fostered a supportive environment, allowing team members to voice concerns and provide input on various aspects of the project. The meetings served as a platform for team members to learn about each other's strengths and expertise, which will be beneficial as we move forward. However, the time conflicts underscored the importance of improving our scheduling practices to ensure that all members can participate fully in discussions.


## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
Throughout this week, the team gained valuable insights into the importance of effective task allocation and the establishment of clear milestones. The discussions during our client meeting emphasized the necessity of aligning our project goals with client expectations. We learned that regular communication is vital for maintaining transparency and trust with our clients, which will ultimately contribute to the success of the project. Additionally, understanding the project’s objectives and each member's role will enhance our collaboration and efficiency.

## Plans for Next Week

Our primary focus for next week will be to complete the SOW and Team Charter. These documents are essential for outlining our project objectives, deliverables, and the roles and responsibilities of each team member.

#### Continue Developing the Landing Page [#18](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/18) :
We will also continue working on the landing page, ensuring that it aligns with our project goals and provides a user-friendly experience.

Lastly, we will confirm the date and time for our next client meeting, scheduled for August 9. This meeting will provide an opportunity to review our progress and discuss any adjustments needed based on client feedback.

## Conclusion
Overall, Week2 was a productive and insightful period for the EduKATE Project Team. We made significant progress in task allocation, milestone establishment, and communication with our clients. The meetings not only facilitated a better understanding of the project’s objectives but also helped team members build rapport and establish a collaborative environment. While we encountered challenges related to scheduling, the team demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Moving forward, enhancing our coordination and communication will be crucial for maintaining momentum and achieving our project goals. We are optimistic about the upcoming week and look forward to building on our successes.
