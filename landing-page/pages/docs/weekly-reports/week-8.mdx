# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
#### Client Meeting and Progress Demo [#241](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/241): 
This week, we held a productive client meeting where we showcased the latest developments of our visual programming tool. The demo highlighted the current interface and functionality, allowing the client to see firsthand how our application is evolving. The feedback received during this meeting was invaluable, as it provided clarity on specific logic blocks and their implementation.
  
#### Implementation of Block-Based Language Logic [#225](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/225): 
We made significant progress in connecting the block-based language logic to the app's interface. This integration is crucial for ensuring that the application functions as a prototype, allowing us to demonstrate its core features effectively.
  
#### Optimization of Block Execution Logic [#245](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/245): 
We focused on optimizing the current block execution logic by adding control blocks such as "if-else" statements and "wait" commands. This enhancement is essential for improving the overall functionality of the app and ensuring that it can execute a series of commands smoothly.
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Clarification on Block Logic Implementation [#241](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/241): 
During our client meeting, we identified areas where further clarification was needed regarding the design and structure of various logic blocks, particularly sensing and control blocks. While we received some guidance, additional examples and specifications from the client will be necessary to ensure that we implement these features accurately.

#### Integration Complexity [#245](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/245): 
As we worked on connecting the block-based language logic to the interface, we encountered some complexities related to ensuring seamless integration between different components. However, through collaboration and communication within the team, we were able to address these challenges effectively.
  
#### Team Collaboration [#234](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/234):
This week, our collaboration was strengthened through open communication during the client meeting and ongoing discussions about task allocation. The feedback from the client allowed us to align our development efforts with their expectations, fostering a sense of shared purpose among team members. We also maintained regular check-ins to discuss progress on tasks, which helped ensure that everyone was informed and engaged in the project.


## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
We gained valuable insights into the importance of user-centered design during our client meeting. Understanding how children interact with programming tools has emphasized the need for an engaging interface that incorporates colorful animations and sounds. This knowledge will guide our design choices moving forward.

Additionally, we learned about the significance of clear communication with stakeholders regarding project requirements. The discussions around block logic implementation highlighted how crucial it is to seek clarification early in the development process to avoid misunderstandings later on.

## Plans for Next Week
### Goals for Next Week

#### Finalize Block Logic Implementation [#245](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/245): 
Our primary goal is to finalize the implementation of all block logic components based on client feedback, ensuring that they function correctly within the application.

#### Enhance User Interface [#270](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/270): 
We will continue enhancing the user interface by adding sounds and animations to make it more appealing to children, aligning with our target audience's needs.

#### Testing Phase Preparation [#258](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/258), [#267](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/267): 
As we approach Audit 3, we will begin preparing for testing by establishing a structured approach to validate all features and ensure they meet user expectations.

## Conclusion
Overall, Week 8 was a productive period for the EduKATE Project Team, marked by significant progress in developing our visual programming tool and effective collaboration with our client. While challenges related to block logic implementation remain, we are committed to addressing them proactively. The insights gained this week will guide our efforts as we move forward in finalizing our application for Audit 3. We are excited about the upcoming weeks as we continue to refine our project and enhance its functionality.
