# Week in Reflection

## Major Tasks Completed
#### Client Meeting and Progress Demonstration [#256](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/256): 
This week, we successfully showcased the current state of our Picture Block coding interface to the client. The demonstration included the virtual dog icon movement and UI design, which received positive feedback. The client also provided insights on the physical robotic dog delivery timeline, helping us align our development schedule with upcoming hardware availability.
  
#### Improved Layout Structure [#270](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/270): 
We successfully enhanced the layout structure of our application, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. This improvement is crucial for engaging our target audience—young girls—by creating an inviting interface.

#### Added Basic Functions [#268](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/268): 
We implemented several basic functions, including the stop button usage, a "press to run" feature for the code, a virtual start block, and a dog bark sound. These additions significantly enhance the interactivity and functionality of our application.

#### Outcome Space Added [#264](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/264): 
We established an outcome space within the application to display results and feedback from user interactions. This feature is essential for providing users with immediate responses to their coding actions.

#### Created Poster #[#258](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/258) and Finished the Video [#267](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/267): 
We designed a poster that visually summarizes our project and its objectives and completed the promotional video showcasing our application’s features and functionalities. 
  
## Challenges and Team Dynamics
### Challenges Encountered
#### Delayed Client Requirements Document [#261](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/261):
The late delivery of the client’s requirements document has limited our time for thorough planning and development. To mitigate this, we promptly reviewed the document and discussed areas needing clarification, ensuring we address potential issues before they arise during development.

#### Unresponsive Team Member [#262](https://github.com/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE/24-S2-2-C-EduKATE.github.io/issues/262):
One team member's long-term unresponsiveness has created uncertainty about task progress. To manage this, we have implemented regular check-ins and set clear expectations for communication. If the situation does not improve, we may need to reassign their tasks to maintain project momentum.
  
### Team Collaboration
This week, our collaboration was bolstered by effective communication during client meetings and tutorial sessions. The structured approach to our audit presentation preparation ensured that all team members were engaged and aware of their responsibilities. By dividing the presentation into sections, we promoted participation and accountability within the team, fostering a sense of shared ownership over our project outcomes.


## Learning and Insights
### New Skills and Knowledge
We gained valuable insights into the importance of aligning our development efforts with client expectations. The feedback received during our client meeting emphasized the need for a product-centric approach that caters to our target audience—young girls. This understanding will guide our design choices moving forward, ensuring that we create an engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Additionally, we learned about the significance of maintaining a clear timeline and effective communication channels with stakeholders. Regular updates and open discussions will help us manage expectations and reduce potential misunderstandings as we approach critical milestones.


## Plans for Next Week
