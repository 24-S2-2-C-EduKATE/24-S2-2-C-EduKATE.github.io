# About EduKATE

EduKATE Innovations is pioneering the way for young girls in STEM education by creating engaging, educational toys that spark curiosity and empower future innovators. Our current project is the development of an interactive coding application designed to complement our programmable robotic dog. This app offers a progressive learning experience through three distinct coding languages: Picture Block Coding for beginners, Word Block Coding for intermediate users, and Text Coding for those ready to tackle advanced challenges. By blending play with education, we aim to make coding accessible, enjoyable, and inspiring for young minds, laying a solid foundation for a lifelong love of STEM.
