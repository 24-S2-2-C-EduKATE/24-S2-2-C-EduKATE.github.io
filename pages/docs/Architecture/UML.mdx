## User Interface Interaction (UI Module)
- **AccountUI**: Users log in or register through this interface.
- **Coding Interfaces**: Users write or select code through various coding interfaces:
  - `PictureBlockUI`
  - `WordBlockUI`
  - `TextCodingUI`

## Code Execution
- **Execute Code**: After completing the code writing or selection, the user clicks the execute button, which calls the `executeCode()` method.

## Sending Commands to the Controller (Controllers Module)
- **ActionController**: Translates the user's actions from the coding interface into commands and sends them to the `ActionController`.

## Action Execution (Actions Module)
- **ActionController**:
  - Receives the command.
  - Creates an instance of the corresponding subclass of `BaseAction` (e.g., `MoveForwardAction`).
  - Calls the `execute()` method of the action instance to perform the action.

## Updating Model State (Models Module)
- **BaseAction**:
  - Calls relevant methods of `RobotDog` (e.g., `moveForward()`) to update the robot dog's state.
- **Chessboard**:
  - Updates the display of the chessboard if necessary by calling the `render()` method.

## User Interface Update (UI Module)
- **ChessboardUI**: Triggers a redraw to present the updated state of the chessboard to the user.

## Hardware Communication (Hardware Module)
- **ArduinoInterface**: Converts the action into a command that the hardware can understand and sends it via the `sendCommand()` method.

## Hardware Action Execution
- **Hardware (e.g., Arduino)**: Receives the command, parses it, and performs the corresponding hardware operations (e.g., driving the robot dog to move or turn).

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Frontend**: PyQt
- **Backend**: Modular
