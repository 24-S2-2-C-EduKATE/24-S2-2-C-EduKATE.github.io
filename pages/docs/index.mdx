# EduKATE

**EduKATE** Innovations is developing a robotic dog designed to teach foundational coding skills through an engaging app. The toy uses a custom block coding language, allowing users to program it by creating code blocks. Interactive lessons tailored to individual skill levels guide users through the coding process, enabling them to see their code come to life on the robotic dog. This approach aims to make STEM education more accessible and appealing, particularly to young girls, to enhance gender diversity in the field.
